# HUD-CORE
HUD-CORE.js provides the client-side functionality needed for Spaceport's Launchpad
features including server reactions and actions, server document data, and server elements.

If you're using a Spaceport Starter Kit, this file may already be included.

If your Spaceport doesn't use any Launchpad features, this file may not be necessary
to include in your project.
